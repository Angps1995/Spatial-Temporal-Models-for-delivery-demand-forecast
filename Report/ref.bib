The package allows for models with the identity and with the logarithmic link function. The conditional distribution can be Poisson or negative binomial. An important special case of this class is the so-called INGARCH model and its log-linear extension. The package includes methods for model fitting and assessment, prediction and intervention analysis. This paper summarizes the theoretical background of these methods. It gives details on the implementation of the package and provides simulation results for models which have not been studied theoretically before. The usage of the package is illustrated by two data examples. Additionally, we provide a review of R packages which can be used for count time series analysis.

Even though the history of STARMA Models starts from 1980's, these models remained in the shadows because of both lack of variable sets and its estimation difficulties. When the literature is examined, it's seen that STARMA Models can be estimated by linear and non-linear estimators. It's seen that the non-linear estimators are producing more efficient results because of the variable's structure. For this reason, in this study, Kalman Filters and maximum likelihood estimator has been used. The calculation of spatial weight matrix is done with software “Kure” which is developing by our team. As the case study, regional deposits of commercial banks operating in Turkey were analysed. Statistically significant and robust results revealed that STARMA Model has high estimation performance."

%	abstract = {Beginning with Hodgson (Geogr.Anal.22(1990) 270), several researchers have been developing a new kind of location-allocation model for "flow capturing." Instead of locating central facilities to serve demand at fixed points in space, their models aim to serve demand consisting of origin-destination flows along their shortest paths. This paper extends flow-capturing models to optimal location of refueling facilities for alternative-fuel (alt-fuel) vehicles, such as hydrogen fuel cells or natural gas. Existing flow-capturing models assume that if a flow passes just one facility along its path, it is covered. This assumption does not carry over to vehicle refueling because of the limited range of vehicles. For refueling, it may be necessary to stop at more than one facility in order to successfully refuel the entire path, depending on the vehicle range, the path length, and the node spacing. The Flow Refueling Location Model (FRLM) optimally locates p refueling stations on a network so as to maximize the total flow volume refueled. This paper presents a mixed-integer programming formulation for the nodes-only version of the problem, as well as an algorithm for determining all combinations of nodes that can refuel a given path. A greedy-adding approach is demonstrated to be suboptimal, and the tradeoff curve between number of facilities and flow volume refueled is shown to be nonconvex. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Meanwhile, lack of fuel network infrastructures is a major problem, which needs to be investigated considering the number and optimal location of alternative fuel stations. In the literature, two different flow-based demand modeling concepts (the maximum cover and set cover) have been proposed for solving this problem. Because of the huge number of combinations of fuel stations for covering the flow of each path, the models are impractical for the real size problems. In this paper, the flow refueling location model was reformulated and a flexible mixed-integer linear programming model was presented, which was able to obtain an optimal solution much faster than the previous set cover version. The model also could be solved in the maximum cover form in a reasonable time on the large-sized networks.},

%	abstract = {Increased interest in alternative fuels is attributable, in part, to rising oil prices and increasing concern about global warming. A lack of a refueling infrastructure, however, has inhibited the adoption of alternative-fuel vehicles. Little economic incentive exists to mass-produce alternative-fuel vehicles until a network of stations exists that can refuel a reasonable number of trips. The flow refueling location model (FRLM) was developed to minimize the investment necessary to create a refueling infrastructure by optimizing the location of fueling stations. The original uncapacitated FRLM assumes that the presence of a refueling station is sufficient to serve all flows passing through a node, regardless of their volume. This article introduces the capacitated flow refueling location model that limits the number of vehicles refueled at each station. It also introduces a modified objective function maximizing vehicle-miles traveled instead of trips, applies both models to an intercity network for Arizona, and formulates several other extensions.},

%	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) have been proposed as a key technology to help cut down the massive greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Unfortunately, because of the limited capacity of batteries, typical EVs can only travel for about 100 miles on a single charge and require hours to be recharged. The industry has proposed a novel solution centered around the use of “swapping stations,” at which depleted batteries can be exchanged for recharged ones in the middle of long trips. The possible success of this solution hinges on the ability of the charging service provider to deploy a cost-effective infrastructure network, given only limited information regarding adoption rates. We develop robust optimization models that aid the planning process for deploying battery-swapping infrastructure. Using these models, we study the potential impacts of battery standardization and technology advancements on the optimal infrastructure deployment strategy.},

%	abstract = {This paper studies the problem of multistage place- ment of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations with incremental EV penetration rates. A nested logit model is employed to analyze the charging preference of the individual consumer (EV owner) and predict the aggregated charging demand at the charging stations. The EV charging industry is modeled as an oligopoly where the entire market is dominated by a few charging ser- vice providers (oligopolists). At the beginning of each planning stage, an optimal placement policy for each service provider is obtained through analyzing strategic interactions in a Bayesian game. To derive the optimal placement policy, we consider both the transportation network graph and the electric power net- work graph. A simulation software—the EV Virtual City 1.0—is developed using Java to investigate the interactions among the consumers (EV owner), the transportation network graph, the electric power network graph, and the charging stations. Through a series of experiments using the geographic and demographic data from the city of the San Pedro District of Los Angeles, CA, USA, we show that the charging station placement is highly consistent with the heatmap of the traffic flow. In addition, we observe a spatial economic phenomenon that service providers prefer clustering instead of separation in the EV charging market.},

We prove that a global optimum of OPF can be obtained by solving a second-order cone program, under a mild condition after shrinking the OPF feasible set slightly, for radial power networks. The condition can be checked a priori, and holds for the IEEE 13, 34, 37, 123-bus networks and two real-world networks.},
